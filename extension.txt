The Problem we solved:
We design a problem which is using the facebook database and find their mutual
friends for the random entered 2 people on the list.

How we solved it:
We create a graph using vector based on all the friends in the file, we use
DFS search for one level below and exhausted search for the entire one below level
to see if they have mutual friends. If there is no mutual
friends we print out "there are no mutual friends" if there are mutual friends
we print them on the ternimal. If they are the same person we print "This is the same person",
and if we cannot find the user, we print we cannot find the exact user.

How we test it:
we create a small_extension_testfile.tsv for our tests. in the small test file
we made 1 have mutual friends with 2, 2 have mutual friends with 3, 1 have no
mutual friends with 3, and no body have mutual friends with 4. we run the
the program with ./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 1 2, result is 3 4 5 6
./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 2 3, result is 4 5 6 7 8 9
./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 1 3, result is 2 4 5 6
./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 1 4, No mutual friends
./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 2 4, No mutual friends
./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 3 4, No mutual friends
and all of our results are correct. we also handle the case when
same person entered twice. we will print out a message said that
"This is the same person". If the person is not on the list we print out error
message which is "User (whoever entered to search) doesn't exist."

how the grader run our program:
grader should simply 'make' and there will be a executable file 'extension'
run it as:
1st argument is: the databse file for exmaple small_extension_testfile.tsv
2nd argument is: the first person as a int
3rd argument is: the second person as a int
./extension small_extension_testfile.tsv 1 2
for small_extension_testfile please choose user from 1 to 4
for facebook_1000.txt please choose user from 0 to 999
for facebook_1000.txt please choose user from 0 to 1999
for facebook_1000.txt please choose user from 0 to 14947
